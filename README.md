# ramly

> Currently being adapted for npm package.

A small tool for rendering a set of raml definitions.

## Why?

I needed to manage several separate RAML files,
it is delayed to render each one manually,
so I decided to write a small tool to dynamically
compile all raml files and then make them accessible
from a main site.
